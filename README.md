Unity can grind to a halt when it has hundreds of assets installed. This makes working with a large complex scene painful. Workflows helps break a single scene down into individual stages of development. Focusing on making it as easy as possible to install the required assets for each stage in the workflow and pass the completed work from one stage to the next. 

# Getting Started

1. Fork the [Workflow repository](https://github.com/3dtbd/Workflows)
2. Create your Unity project
3. `git init`
4. `mkdir Assets/3dtbd`
5. `cd Assets/3dtbd`
6. `git submodule add [[Path to your fork]]`
7. In unity open the Workflow Manager using `Tools/3dtbd/Workflow`
